If you are a teacher interested in having David present this talk at your school please contact him at drasmus@ncsu.edu. 

Please note this presentation is meant for relavtively advanced high school biology students (i.e. AP Biology students) and works best if students already have some prior exposure to evolution and phylogenetic trees.
